# rover_science
ROS2 and other software package for controlling science of UNewHaven's URC 2025 rover's science assay.

This was the version we ended up using for the actual science mission during URC, which (((mostly))) worked exactly as intended due to stripping out all non necessary functions and parts of the code that were more buggy than helpful.
